## Behavior Notes

### Pane Focus Model

The UI has three panes with visual focus indication:
1. **Sidebar** - Account/folder list
2. **Message List** - Conversations in selected folder
3. **Conversation Viewer** - Selected conversation content

Clicking a pane focuses it. Focus is indicated by a subtle border flash animation.

### Folder Navigation

`Alt+Up/Down` navigates through all folders in visual order:
1. Unified Inbox (All Inboxes)
2. Individual account inboxes under Unified Inbox
3. Account 1 header
4. Account 1 folders (if expanded)
5. Account 2 header
6. Account 2 folders (if expanded)
7. ... and so on

Collapsed accounts show only their header (not folders) in navigation.

### Message Actions Hierarchy

Action shortcuts (Delete, Archive, Spam, Star, Read/Unread) follow this priority:

1. **Checked messages** - If any messages are checked (via Space or Shift+navigation), actions apply to ALL checked messages
2. **Keyboard-focused message** - Otherwise, actions apply to the message that's currently focused in the message list (the one with keyboard highlight from j/k navigation)
3. The message being viewed in the conversation pane is independent - you can navigate to and delete a different message without opening it first

First `Escape` clears checkboxes, second `Escape` closes the conversation viewer.

### Composer Blocking

When the composer is open:
- `Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+Shift+R`, `Ctrl+F` are blocked to prevent accidental replies
- Other global shortcuts continue to work

### Rail Navigation

`Ctrl+Tab` cycles forward through the rail items: Mail → Contacts → Mail.
`` Ctrl+` `` cycles backward. The active rail pane is persisted across launches.

Composer state is preserved across switches: switching to Contacts and back does not unmount or clear the composer.

### Unified Inbox

When viewing Unified Inbox and replying:
- Reply uses the account associated with the selected message
- This ensures replies come from the correct email address

---

## Contacts Pane

Contacts shortcuts only fire when Contacts is the active rail pane (selected via `Ctrl+Tab` / `` Ctrl+` ``). They never trigger while Mail is active, so shortcuts that overlap with Mail's are routed by the active rail pane.

Pane-local navigation (Up/Down/J/K, Enter, Space, Alt+H/L for pane cycling, Alt+Up/Down for sidebar) uses the same kit-shared predicates Mail does.

**Sidebar navigation (works from any pane)**

Mirrors mail's "Folder Navigation" shortcuts. These fire regardless of which contacts pane currently has keyboard focus — so you can scroll through addressbooks while the list or detail pane is focused.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Up` / `Alt+K` | Move to previous source / addressbook in the sidebar |
| `Alt+Down` / `Alt+J` | Move to next source / addressbook in the sidebar |

**Pane cycling**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Left` / `Alt+H` | Focus previous pane (detail → list → sidebar) |
| `Alt+Right` / `Alt+L` | Focus next pane (sidebar → list → detail) |

**Actions**

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `E` | Edit the currently-focused contact |
| `Ctrl+N` | Open the new-contact dialog |

> Within a focused pane, `Up`/`K` and `Down`/`J` cycle rows (contact list, sidebar sources) and `Enter` opens / activates — same kit predicates Mail's list and folder tree use.
